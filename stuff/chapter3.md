# Chapter 3: Radio Liberty

Survivor enters Radio Liberty, finds LIBBY, makes ultimate choice.

LIBBY is an entity that was trapped here, as a part of an experiment to try and restore climate. By hurting the entity, energy is released and helps balance the climate change.

The entity contacts you, it needs you to set her free.

Killing the entity saves the planet, restores climate, but hurts human beings (as revenge or just because reasons?), extingishing the species forever.

Freeing the entity has no impact on the climate change, which will slowly keep making life on earth harder, eventually causing a mass extinction event.
