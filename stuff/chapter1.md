# Chapter 1: Stranded

## Scene 1: the road

### Cutscene

Survivor is traveling by solar powered buggy. Some music. Some subtitles explaining the basic idea of the world.
Radio static interrupts music. Buggy slows down to a halt.

**SURVIVOR:**
"What the…?"

Survivor steps down of the car. Player gets control. Some prompt to help the user? Tap/click to move around

### Player

Player should click the car. Survivor gets close and inspects

### Cutscene

\* messes with the engine \*

**SURVIVOR:**
"Hmm that's weird. Nothing seems to be wrong with the engine, it's just not getting any power, the battery is completely dead."

\* messes with the engine some more \*

**SURVIVOR:**
"Uh, it doesn't look like something that I can fix today. It's getting late so I should find some place to rest anyway.
There is some sort of building down the road. Looks like a good shelter, I'll can push the buggy to there, doesn't look too far"

Fades to black, ends Scene 1

## Scene 2: the building

### Cutscene

Camera pans around the area. Radio antennas are visible on the horizon. Buggy is next to a half-build, abandoned building. There are some signs that the building has served as a shelter for someone else. The word LIBBY is written all through the walls.

**SURVIVOR:**
"Hm, doesn't look like anyone is been here for some time, but I bet I can find something useful lying around. I should start a fire and find some food and water, I'm running low"

### Player

When player gets upstairs, cutscene starts

### Cutscene

A man appears from the left side. He is dressed in a lab coat and he looks crazy.

**SURVIVOR:**
"Oh… Hello"

**SAVAGE:**
"Grr…"

**SURVIVOR:**
"Uhm… I'm sorry, I thought the place was abandoned, my car broke down and… eh…"

Savage approaches a bit, still growling

**SURVIVOR:**
"Doesn't look like I'm going to be able to reason with that guy"

Player gets control

### Player

- Do nothing or Flee
  - The savage attacks. Player dies? Or jumps to cutscene anyway. To decide
- Use electric gun/taser
  - Starts cutscene

### Cutscene

Savage attacks and throws survivor to the floor and bites her. Life bar goes down. While defending herself, survivor rips a piece of cloth of the savage's coat.

Then the Survivor's radio starts doing some static noise.

Savage gets scared and flees.

Survivor gets up (it would be cool if animation was different when hurt)

**SURVIVOR:**
"Fuck… What the hell just happened? Geez, I should find some medical supplies to treat the wounds as soon as possible"

### Player

Life bar should be lowering at a considerable pace. If player doesn't find and use medical supplies, player dies. As bandage, the ripped cloth must be used. When picking it up, there is also an ID card attached to it. Mentions some "Radio Liberty"

Once player finds all the supplies, fire is started and water collector setup, night falls. Aurora borealis show up.

**SURVIVOR:**
"How strange, to see northern lights so far down south. I wonder if there is some electromagnetic anomaly around here… could explain why the buggy's electrical system died. Anyway… I should get some rest now. Tomorrow I'll head into town and see if I can find out what the hell is going on."
